## Multicollinearity
In regression, 'multicollinearity' refers to predictors that are correlated with other predictors. Multicollinearity occurs when a model includes multiple variables that are correlated not just with the target variable, but also with each other. In other words, it occurs with redundant variables.

If the correlation between two predictor variables is above > 90%, it means that those two variables have a strong correlation between them. So, instead of using both the variables as predictors to predict the target variable we can can only use one of them.

How to find the correlation betweem two variables, and How to decide which one to choose of those two?
The following code first explores the multicollinearity and then the exercises a simple regression problem.
